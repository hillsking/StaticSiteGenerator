## Reasons I like Tolkien

- You can spend **years** studying the legendarium and still _**not** understand_ its depths
- It can be enjoyed by children and adults alike
- Disney _didn't ruin it_ (okay, but Amazon might have)
- It created an entirely new genre of fantasy

## My favorite characters (in order)

1. Gandalf
2. Bilbo
3. Sam
4. Glorfindel
5. Galadriel
6. Elrond
7. Thorin
8. Sauron
9. Aragorn

## Books & Reading Stats

**The Lord of the Rings** has > 1,000 pages of pure adventure, while **The Hobbit** has < 400 pages but is equally brilliant. The reading experience is like this: _LOTR > everything else_.

Fun fact: Tolkien used over 10,000 unique words, making his vocabulary stats impressive: `vocabulary_richness = unique_words / total_words > 0.15`

As Professor Tolkien said: "Fantasy is escapist, and that is its glory." He also noted that **"myths & legends"** are the foundation of all great stories.

Here's what `elflang` looks like (the perfect coding language):

```
func main(){
    fmt.Println("Aiya, Ambar!")
}
```
